## :eyes: About the project

Windows Artifacts Generator is a tool for creating malware's artifacts for detection testing.

### :question: Why

It's useful for testing configurations, rules or your Endpoint Detection and Response. \
It's not intended to fully simulate the comportment of malware but reproduce steps that led to artifacts creation. \
By avoiding full and complex simulations, Windows Artifacts Generator seek to be simple but nonetheless powerful.

## :rocket: Getting started

This is an example of how you can build the project yourself.

### :gear: Prerequisites

### :hammer_and_wrench: Build

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/frack113/WAG/
    ```

2.  Build the project!

    ```sh
    cargo build
    ```

After these steps, the application will be in the target directory.
